```
@unpublished{miltenburg2018talking,
	Author = {Emiel van Miltenburg and Desmond Elliott and Piek Vossen},
	Note = {Accepted for publication at INLG 2018},
	Title = {Talking about other people: an endless range of possibilities},
	Year = {2018}}
```

## Folder structure

There are three folders:

1. `Flickr30K` contains all code and data for the categorization of person labels in Flickr30k-Entities.
2. `VisualGenome` contains code and data for the categorization of attributes from Visual Genome.
3. `Other` contains some additional functions to compute relevant statistics.

## General requirements

The code has been tested with the following software. Results shouldn't be different
for other versions of Python or the NLTK, but this is untested.

* Python 3.6.3
* nltk 3.2.2
